# Task ID: 18
# Title: Integrate Paddle for Paid Name Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Paddle payment processing integration to enable one-time payments for the paid name generation feature, allowing users to unlock premium functionality.
# Details:
1. Create a Paddle account and configure products/prices specifically for the paid name generation feature.
2. Install and configure the Paddle.js SDK within the Next.js application architecture.
3. Design and implement UI components for payment initiation, including a 'Proceed to Payment' button that appears when users select the paid option from Task 17.
4. Initialize the Paddle SDK with appropriate vendor ID and product ID when a user initiates the payment process.
5. Implement the complete Paddle checkout flow, offering both overlay and inline checkout options based on UX requirements.
6. Create handlers for successful payment callbacks that:
   - Update application state to reflect payment completion
   - Store payment verification in session storage or as a short-lived client-side token
   - Enable access to the paid generation API (from Task 16) for the current session
7. Implement robust error handling for payment failures or cancellations, with clear user feedback and retry options.
8. Ensure proper integration with the free/paid selection UI from Task 17, making this payment flow a prerequisite for accessing the paid Gemini API from Task 16.
9. Implement appropriate loading states during payment processing to improve user experience.
10. Add logging for payment events to assist with troubleshooting and analytics.
11. Consider implementing basic analytics to track conversion rates from selection to payment completion.

# Test Strategy:
1. Configure and thoroughly test the Paddle sandbox environment before moving to production.
2. Create comprehensive test cases covering the entire payment flow:
   - Verify the Paddle checkout launches correctly when a user selects the paid option
   - Test with various payment methods available in the sandbox
   - Confirm the checkout UI renders properly on different devices and screen sizes
3. Test successful payment scenarios:
   - Verify callback handling correctly updates application state
   - Confirm the paid API becomes accessible after successful payment
   - Ensure the UI updates appropriately to reflect payment completion
4. Test payment failure scenarios:
   - Simulate various error conditions (card decline, insufficient funds, etc.)
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed to users
   - Confirm the retry flow works correctly
5. Test payment cancellation:
   - Ensure users can cancel payment and return to the application
   - Verify the application state remains consistent after cancellation
6. Perform integration testing with Task 17 (selection UI) and Task 16 (paid API):
   - Verify the complete flow from selection to payment to API access
7. Conduct security testing to ensure payment information is handled securely.
8. Test session persistence to confirm payment status is maintained appropriately during the user session.
