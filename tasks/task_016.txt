# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Paid Tier Gemini API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with Google Gemini API using a separate API key for paid name generation, offering additional generation options or higher quality results for premium users.
# Details:
1. Store the new API key (AIzaSyCIy4N_gvT221nH3ZZF_k6TBjz3eoNG_ek) securely in `.env.production` and Vercel environment variables, ensuring it's not exposed in client-side code.
2. Create a new module in `lib/gemini-paid.ts` or extend the existing `lib/gemini.ts` with conditional logic to handle paid tier API calls.
3. Implement authentication checks to verify user's subscription status before allowing access to paid features.
4. Configure potentially different model parameters or enhanced prompts for the paid tier to deliver superior results.
5. Add rate limiting specific to the paid tier, likely with higher limits than the free tier.
6. Implement comprehensive logging for paid API calls to track usage and troubleshoot issues.
7. Create a fallback mechanism to the free tier if the paid API encounters persistent errors.
8. Document the differences between free and paid tiers for both users and developers.
9. Ensure proper error handling with specific error messages for paid API failures.
10. Implement response caching strategy appropriate for paid tier requests.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for the paid API integration module, mocking API responses.
2. Implement integration tests with valid inputs to verify successful API calls and response handling.
3. Test error scenarios including network failures, API key issues, and malformed responses.
4. Verify authentication logic correctly restricts access to paid features for non-subscribed users.
5. Test the fallback mechanism to ensure graceful degradation to free tier when necessary.
6. Perform load testing to ensure the paid API can handle expected traffic volumes.
7. Create end-to-end tests simulating real user flows from subscription to using paid features.
8. Verify that response quality and options differ appropriately between free and paid tiers.
9. Test rate limiting functionality to ensure paid users receive their allocated quota.
10. Validate that sensitive information (API key) is not exposed in client-side code or responses.
