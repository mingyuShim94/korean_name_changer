# Overview

## Project Name: NameToKorean (Korean Name Generator)

**Description:** A poetic naming web service that meaningfully reinterprets foreign names into Korean names. This service aims to help users with foreign names explore a new identity by connecting the meaning and sentiment of their names with the beauty of Korean culture. When a user enters their foreign name, the service analyzes the etymology, symbolism, and feel of that name to generate a beautiful Korean name (including surname) that embodies Korean sensibility and tradition, along with its meaning and poetic interpretation.

**Problem Solving:**

- As foreigners' interest in Korean culture increases, there is a demand for having Korean names.
- It's difficult to find a meaningful Korean name that is semantically connected to one's original name, rather than just having similar pronunciation.
- Creating a name that understands cultural background and linguistic nuance while incorporating poetic beauty requires specialized knowledge.

**Target Users:**

- Foreigners interested in Korean culture
- Foreigners who want to form deeper bonds with Korean friends or colleagues
- Parents of multicultural families who want to give their children Korean names with special meanings
- Creators developing characters or pen names

**Value Proposition:**

- Meaningful Connection: Provides a beautiful Korean name that is semantically connected to the user's original name.
- Poetic Sensibility: Goes beyond simple translation to add poetic and emotional interpretation, giving special value to the name.
- Cultural Understanding: Enhances understanding of Korean culture by conveying the cultural background and meaning of Korean surnames and names.
- Easy to Use: Anyone can easily create their own special Korean name through an intuitive interface.
- Various Options: Users can choose gender nuance (masculine, feminine, neutral) and name style (Hanja-based, Pure Korean).
